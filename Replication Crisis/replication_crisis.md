# Replication Crisis

The replication crisis is a major issue occurring in scientific fields.

## Background

1. What is the scientific method?
   1. Ask a question
   2. Construct a hypothesis
   3. Test with an experiment
   4. Analyze data
   5. Draw conclusions
   6. Share results and conclusions
2. What is replication? How does it fit into the scientific method?

   When another scienctist replicates a previous study to determine if the results will be the same

3. What is a scientific **hypothesis**?

   A well educated guess after you have background information

4. What is the difference between a **null hypothesis** and an **alternative hypothesis**?

## The Issue

We will watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q) in class.

1. What is the replication crisis?
2. What are some issues with current scientific research?
3. What is **publish or perish**?
4. What is **p-hacking**?
5. What are some solutions to these issues?

## Example

FiveThirtyEight has a great [demonstration](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/) on p-hacking.

1. What data points allow you to statistically claim that:
   1. Democrats have a positive effect on the economy.
   2. Democrats have a negative effect on the economy.
   3. Republicans have a positive effect on the economy.
   4. Republicans have a negative effect on the economy.
2. Which statements above are backed by data and evidence? Which aren't?
